## Candy Division

### Description
Benny has just found out that he has `n` candies in his pocket. He is always happy to share candies with his friends, because then he doesn’t like eating alone. There is one problem though: he has to be able to divide his candies evenly among everyone (including himself).

Given `n` candies, how many people can Benny invite to eat candies, so that everybody gets the same number of candies and all candies will be eaten? If multiple answers are possible, please provide all possibilities.

### Input
The input contains one integer <code>2 <= n <= 10<sup>12</sup></code>, denoting the number of candies in Benny’s pocket.

### Output
Output an array with all possible number of friends Benny can invite. Output them in ascending order.
