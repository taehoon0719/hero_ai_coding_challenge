## Layout HTML/CSS

### Description
CSS Grid and Flexbox are two important layout models used to create 2D and 1D layouts. This question will evaluate your familiarity with both.
The question is broken down into 2 parts:

1. Implement the layout shown below in HTML/CSS using a Grid model
2. Implement the same layout, but this time using a Flexbox<sup>1</sup> model

<sup>1</sup> You may be wondering why we are asking you to implement this layout in Flexbox when it is clearly a 2D layout more suitable for Grid. 
Unfortunately, React Native does not yet support the Grid layout, so it is important for members of our frontend team to be comfortable with both.

### Task Details
Please create an HTML file to script both layout components and a separate CSS file to store your style objects. You may name these files however you want.
Once you are finished, please add both files in a folder named `layout`. We will not be preoccupied with the visual details of your implementation, but rather focus on the quality of your code and the appropriate use of the Grid and Flexbox models.
